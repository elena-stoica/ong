  <p class="introduction">GreenLa is an nonprofit organization that was founded in order to change the world in the year
    2003.
    The board members, our staff and our volunteers use their creative communication skills in order to promote
    solutions to great global environmental problems.</p>
  <p class="introduction">
    This NGO specializes on saving the wilderness from destruction: taking care of endangered ecosystems and different
    species of plants and animals, protecting ancient rainforests, cleaning our deteriorated oceans and militate against
    global warming&climate change.
    For 18 years GreenLa has tried to make the world a better place and our mission is to never stop doing that.
    We've accomplished so much through the years, and even though the COVID-19 pandemic has made it even harder for us
    to preach our goals to the world, we will always find a way to promote the good, sustainable lifestyle to others.

            raise money and donate it to stop the wildfires. A big GreenLa team went there in order to help the people

            We encourage using the bycicle among citizens with the help of public awareness campaigns. Also, in many
            different cities around the world we tried to make the "Green Friday" possible. After discussing with the
            public administration they agreed with our idea. A day in the week in which all public transport is free, so
            that people feel like they are saving money by traveling with public transportation for the day.

            Our staff members, grouped with volunteers, organized a lot of visits at schools all over the world in order

            interactive ways how to contribute to making the world a better, cleaner, safer space.
