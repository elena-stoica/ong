    With the help of the AWG (Air-Water-Ground) project people learn more about the importance of a healthy living environment. 
    GreenLa encourages everyone to travel by bus, to leave their cars at home if they can. 
    We are building recycling centers around the world. People can dump their plastic, burnt cooking oils so they won't poison the waters anymore.
    When did we stopped eating natural foods? Our ONG supports permaculture and more people should learn about it. Little corners of heaven full of life can be grown even in your tiny apartment!

  <p class="existi2">It is statistically proven that a lot of the ocean waste is produced by big corporations. Our team planned an interesting project. A coastal ocean cleaning campaign was organized and our staff also created a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.inthepocket.fostplus.recyclage">social media app</a> in which you could get inspired on ways to lead a more sustainable life. The app showed to people which corporations dump the most waste in the oceans, which companies pollute more and needed to be avoided. It also provided users with tips&tricks on how to be more responsible, how to support local businesses, how to respect the opinions of native peoples etc. </p>

  <h3>Eating animal based foods minus the suffering</h3>
  <div class="column3">
  
    <p class="existi">You've probably heard everyone say "I love animals". But do they mean <b>all</b> animals It kinda seems like most people are reffering to dogs, cats, in general pets. How can you label yourself an animal lover when you sacrifice pigs, lambs, horses for your own vanity and pleasure when so many meat alternatives exist? We encourage eating animal based foods like eggs, milk, cheese, but only if they were made by animals that live happily, not in cages. So, over the years, animal sancturies were built and we treasure the produce our happy cows, goats, chickens deliver to us. We donate all the produce to people who need it the most. We don't make any profit out of it.</p>
